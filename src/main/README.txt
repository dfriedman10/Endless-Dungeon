Welcome to the Endless Dungeon!

The Endless Dungeon is a turn based RPG in which the player must slay monsters to gain experience, level up, and get stronger.

Warning: All stat allocations are final. There are no second chances in the Endless Dungeon.

Controls:
	To pause and unpause the game, the player must hit the SPACEBAR. This allows the player to allocate stat points.
	Mouse is used to choose options on screen.
	
Basics:
	Stamina Points (SP) are spent to perform physical attacks. 
	Mana Points (MP) are spent to cast spells.
	Health Points (HP) keep the player alive. If they run out, they and their experience will be absorbed by the Endless Dungeon.
	Experience Points (XP) determine when the player will level up. Fill up the XP bar to level up. Stronger monsters give more XP.
	Level determines the number of stat points a player has. Every time the player levels up, they gain 5 additional stat points to spend and refill their HP.
	Stat Points are the measure a player's might. They have a powerful effect on the player's abilities. You start the game with 5 points to spend.
	
Stat Lore:
	Strength is said to increase the power of physical attacks.
	Constitution is the very substance of the body. Stamina and health depend upon it (including Stamina regeneration).
	Intelligence is the ability to use and store mana to power spells.
	Wisdom determines the player's ability to absorb and regenerate mana, and it has minor bonus effects on stabbing attacks and spells.
	Luck is the chance the player will attack the monster in a critical area. It is scalable, but with luck nothing is guaranteed...
	
Monster Lore:
	Goblins are said to have a high resistance to magic, but they tend to fall quickly to the sword.
	Slimes are said to have legendary resistance to physical attacks. Perhaps magic would do the trick?
	Snow Monsters are tough enemies that will wear you down over time.
	Defeating boss monsters will force new energy into the player, causing them to forget a current skill in favor of a new one.
	
Have fun exploring the Endless Dungeon and collecting experience!
